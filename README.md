RayTracerKCL :

This project is part of the group project that is to be implemented in King's College London.

Ray Tracing is a rendering technique which takes simple 2D objects such as circles,squares or rectangles and produces 3D rendering of these objects in the form of spheres,cubes,cuboid. We have implemented a Raytracer using this raytracing technique.

Middle East group is a group made of 6 members :

Roshini Ashokkumar, 
Nandhini Sreekumar, 
Norah Alsuwily, 
Tamanna Qureshi,
Sara Alotaibi,
Maryam Yasin.

We have used C++ for the implementation of the front and the backend and used QTCreator for the front-end.
