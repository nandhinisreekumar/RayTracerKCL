## RayTracerKCL :

This project is part of the group project that is to be implemented in King's College London.

Ray Tracing is a rendering technique which takes simple 2D objects such as circles,squares or rectangles and produces 3D rendering of these objects in the form of spheres,cubes,cuboid. We have implemented a Raytracer using this raytracing technique.

Middle East group is a group made of 6 members :

* Roshini Ashokkumar 
* Nandhini Sreekumar
* Norah Alsuwily
* Tamanna Qureshi
* Sara Alotaibi
* Maryam Yasin

We have used C++ for the implementation of the front and the backend and used QTCreator for the front-end.

## Execution Instructions

	Have the Project Folder RayTracerKCL stored on your Desktop
	So that the Scene.txt will always be saved in the directory:
		C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\Desktop\RayTracerKCL\RayTraceFrontEnd
		
## From the Front-End
1. Install QT 
2. Load QT
3. Open File
4. Select the folder RayTraceFrontEnd in C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\Desktop\RayTracerKCL\RayTraceFrontEnd

6. Press the run button
7. Select any values you want for each drop down menu
8. Press save when happy with the image you want 
9. Go to the C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\Desktop\RayTracerKCL\RayTraceFrontEnd folder to view the image Scene.png


## From the Back-End

 - If you you have all the neccessary c++ files installed and added to your systems enviroment variables:
